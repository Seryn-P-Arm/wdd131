                <article class="awareness-paragraph">
                    <p>Commissions are a great way to get a unique, custom-made piece of art that fits your vision! But before we dive in, here are a few things to keep in mind: Art takes time, and every piece goes through a process—from sketching to refining to final touches. The complexity of the design, revisions, and details all play a role in determining the final cost and timeframe. To make the process smooth and enjoyable for both of us, it really helps if you provide clear references, communicate what you’re looking for, and have an idea of your budget. Don’t worry, though—I’ll guide you every step of the way!</p>
